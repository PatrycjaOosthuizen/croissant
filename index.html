            <strong>🥐 Austrian origins</strong> <br />
            <br />They aren't really French Shocking, We know! These delicious
            pastries are said to have been invented in Vienna, Austria. Once
            upon a time in 1683 Vienna, Austria the Turkish tried to invade
            Vienna during a big battle siege over the city. Failing each time
            they decided to dig an underground tunnel, but Vienna’s bakers, who
            worked in the basement storerooms, heard the digging and alerted the
            army. The Turkish invaders didn’t succeed and the bakers of Vienna
            were given high honors for saving the city. Bakers made pastry in
            the shape of a crescent moon, that is the symbol of the Ottoman
            Empire (also known as the Turkish Empire), to celebrate this
            victory.

            (the German word for crescent) and the Vienna loaf. This bakery
            inspired imitators and the French version of the kipferl was named
            after the shape given to it: a crescent – the French word being
            croissant.

            <br />
            Croissants are part of the category of pastries that the French call
            Viennoiseries, a nod to their origins in Vienna.

              own</strong
            ><br />
            <br />
            Jim Chevallier, an independent scholar and author of the book
            “August Zang and the French Croissant: How Viennoiserie Came to
            France” says that while the croissant may have had Austrian origins,
            the French made it their own: “The croissant began as the Austrian
            kipferl but became French the moment people began to make it with
            puffed pastry, which is a French innovation.” And: “It has fully
            taken root in its adopted land.” If you were to order a kipferl in
            Austria today, you will most likely be given a cookie rather than a
            pastry, with the only resemblance to the croissant being its
            crescent shape.

            <strong>🥐 A relatively recent recipe</strong><br />
            <br />The first known modern-day French croissant recipe wasn’t
            created until the early 1900s.A croissant recipe showing the use of
            yeasted puff pastry dough instead of brioche that was used
            previously first appeared in 1905 in the book Colombie’s “NOUVELLE
            ENCYCLOPEDIE CULINAIRE. Cuisine et Pâtisserie Bourgeoises conserves
            de ménage.”The Croissant became the French national product in 1920
            and started as a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth
            century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche).

            <strong> 🥐 Lamination</strong> <br />
            <br />Croissants are typically made by folding butter into dough,
            rolling the dough into sheets, and then continuing the folding and
            rolling process known as ‘lamination’, before cutting and rolling
            into a crescent shape and baking in an oven.

            <strong>🥐 How many layers are there in a croissant? </strong
            ><br /><br />
            Different bakers make their croissants with a different number of
            folds and turns. But most fold their croissant dough into thirds at
            each turn before spreading it with a roller and folding it again
            into thirds for a total of 3 or 4 turns. So if a baker folds his
            dough 3 times each turn for a total of 3 turns, the resulting
            croissant dough will have 27 layers while 4 turns results in a
            croissant dough with 81 layers. After the laminating process, bakers
            cut the croissant dough into triangles and roll the dough into their
            famous crescent shape, increasing the number of layers in the
            croissant by two for each roll. Most recipes recommend 3 or 4 rolls.
            Laminated dough with 81 layers, rolled 4 times, will result in a
            croissant with 649 layers. Mind blowing, isn’t it?
