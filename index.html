      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

      Fascinating Facts About Croissants To Blow Your Mind
    </h2>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 They aren't really French Shocking, we know! These delicious pastries
      are said to have been invented in Vienna, Austria. Once upon a time in
      1683 Vienna, Austria the Turkish tried to invade Vienna during a big
      battle siege over the city. Failing each time they decided to dig an
      underground tunnel, but Vienna’s bakers, who worked in the basement
      storerooms, heard the digging and alerted the army. The Turkish invaders
      didn’t succeed and the bakers of Vienna were given high honors for saving
      the city. Bakers made pastry in the shape of a crescent moon, that is the
      symbol of the Ottoman Empire (also known as the Turkish Empire), to
      celebrate this victory.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Zang">August Zang</a>, an
      Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing the croissant to
      France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris.
      <br />
      Some say it was
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette">
        Marie Antoinette</a
      >
      who brought the croissant to France… The Queen of the French Revolution is
      famously attributed for the phrase, “Let them eat cake”. But what she
      really said, when told that the population was in revolt because they had
      no bread, was, “Let them eat croissant”.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 The first known modern-day French croissant recipe wasn’t created until
      the early 1900s.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 The Croissant became the French national product in 1920 and started as
      a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it was
      middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche).
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or
      shell, not to eat on its own.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 The chocolate croissant is actually called pain au chocolat, as it is
      not in the shape of a crescent.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 Croissants are typically made by folding butter into dough, rolling the
      dough into sheets, and then continuing the folding and rolling process
      known as ‘laminating’, before cutting and rolling into a crescent shape
      and baking in an oven.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 How many layers are there in a croissant? Different bakers make their
      croissants with a different number of folds and turns. But most fold their
      croissant dough into thirds at each turn before spreading it with a roller
      and folding it again into thirds for a total of 3 or 4 turns. So if a
      baker folds his dough 3 times each turn for a total of 3 turns, the
      resulting croissant dough will have 27 layers while 4 turns results in a
      croissant dough with 81 layers. After the laminating process, bakers cut
      the croissant dough into triangles and roll the dough into their famous
      crescent shape, increasing the number of layers in the croissant by two
      for each roll. Most recipes recommend 3 or 4 rolls. Laminated dough with
      81 layers, rolled 4 times, will result in a croissant with 649 layers.
      Mind blowing, isn’t it?
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 There are only 8 ingredients in a French croissant recipe. The basic
      ingredients for a classic French croissant au beurre are: 1) butter, 2)
      flour, 3) water, 4) milk, 5) yeast, 6) sugar 7) salt and 8) egg.

      A croissant should be golden brown, crispy and flaky on the outside with
      visible layers. The interior should be soft and airy with honeycomb air
      pockets. It should taste rich and slightly buttery but should not be too
      greasy just as you will get them in our Cafe Brunch restaurants. Now there
      is only one thing waiting for you.. our delishh croissants to try!
