      Fascinating Facts About Croissant To Blow Your Mind
    </h2>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 Austrian origins
      <br />They aren't really French Shocking, I know! These delicious pastries
      are said to have been invented in Vienna, Austria. Once upon a time in
      1683 Vienna, Austria the Turkish tried to invade Vienna during a big
      battle siege over the city. Failing each time they decided to dig an
      underground tunnel, but Vienna’s bakers, who worked in the basement
      storerooms, heard the digging and alerted the army. The Turkish invaders
      didn’t succeed and the bakers of Vienna were given high honors for saving
      the city. Bakers made pastry in the shape of a crescent moon, that is the
      symbol of the Ottoman Empire (also known as the Turkish Empire), to
      celebrate this victory.

      🥐 A Viennese bakery in Paris <br /><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Zang"
        >August Zang</a
      >, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing the croissant
      to France he opened a Viennese bakery at 92, Rue du Richelieu in Paris. It
      served Viennese specialties including kipferl (the German word for
      crescent) and the Vienna loaf. This bakery inspired imitators and the
      French version of the kipferl was named after the shape given to it: a
      crescent – the French word being croissant.

      🥐 Viennoiseries
      <br />
      Croissants are part of the category of pastries that the French call
      Viennoiseries, a nod to their origins in Vienna.

      🥐 It may have Austrian origins but the French made it their own
      <br />
      Jim Chevallier, an independent scholar and author of the book “August Zang
      and the French Croissant: How Viennoiserie Came to France” says that while
      the croissant may have had Austrian origins, the French made it their own:
      “The croissant began as the Austrian kipferl but became French the moment
      people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation.”
      And: “It has fully taken root in its adopted land.” If you were to order a
      kipferl in Austria today, you will most likely be given a cookie rather
      than a pastry, with the only resemblance to the croissant being its
      crescent shape.

      🥐 Some say it was
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette">
        Marie Antoinette</a
      >
      who brought the croissant to France… The Queen of the French Revolution is
      famously attributed for the phrase, “Let them eat cake”. But what she
      really said, when told that the population was in revolt because they had
      no bread, was, “Let them eat croissant”.

      🥐 A relatively recent recipe
      <br />The first known modern-day French croissant recipe wasn’t created
      until the early 1900s.A croissant recipe showing the use of yeasted puff
      pastry dough instead of brioche that was used previously first appeared in
      1905 in the book Colombie’s “NOUVELLE ENCYCLOPEDIE CULINAIRE. Cuisine et
      Pâtisserie Bourgeoises conserves de ménage.”The Croissant became the
      French national product in 1920 and started as a luxury product, but by
      the end of the nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred
      a good brioche).

    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 Why some croissants are curved and others are straight?
      <br />Croissants that are straight are those made with butter (croissants
      au beurre) and the curved ones are made with margarine (croissants
      ordinaires).
      <br />

    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 Lamination
      <br />Croissants are typically made by folding butter into dough, rolling
      the dough into sheets, and then continuing the folding and rolling process
      known as ‘lamination’, before cutting and rolling into a crescent shape
      and baking in an oven. <br />
      <img
        src="images/raw-croissant-image.png"
        alt="raw croissant image"
        class="img-fluid rounded"
      />
    </p>
    <p class="text-left p-4">
      🥐 How many layers are there in a croissant? <br />
      Different bakers make their croissants with a different number of folds
      and turns. But most fold their croissant dough into thirds at each turn
      before spreading it with a roller and folding it again into thirds for a
      total of 3 or 4 turns. So if a baker folds his dough 3 times each turn for
      a total of 3 turns, the resulting croissant dough will have 27 layers
      while 4 turns results in a croissant dough with 81 layers. After the
      laminating process, bakers cut the croissant dough into triangles and roll
      the dough into their famous crescent shape, increasing the number of
      layers in the croissant by two for each roll. Most recipes recommend 3 or
      4 rolls. Laminated dough with 81 layers, rolled 4 times, will result in a
      croissant with 649 layers. Mind blowing, isn’t it?

      🥐 Ingredients <br />There are only 8 ingredients in a French croissant
      recipe. The basic ingredients for a classic French croissant au beurre
      are: 1) butter, 2) flour, 3) water, 4) milk, 5) yeast, 6) sugar 7) salt
      and 8) egg.

        A croissant should be golden brown, crispy and flaky on the outside with
        visible layers. The interior should be soft and airy with honeycomb air
        pockets. It should taste rich and slightly buttery but should not be too
        greasy just as you will get them in our Cafe Brunch restaurants. Now
        there is only one thing waiting for you... delishh croissants to try!
